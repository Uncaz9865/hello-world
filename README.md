# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow. I'm coming with zero background:)
I want to create a static website to host the conference proceedings, as a complement to their inclusion in the SJSU Institutional Repository.
I am the Institutioanl Repository and Digital Scholarship Coordinator at SJSU.
Thank you, Evan Williamson!
